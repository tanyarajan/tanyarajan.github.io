I am a Ph.D. Candidate in Economics at the University of Chicago. 

**I am on the 2024-25 academic job market.** 

My **[job market paper](https://www.tanyarajan.com/assets/pdf/Rajan_JMP_latest.pdf)** studies worker mobility between formal and informal sector jobs in the garment industry in Bangladesh.

More broadly, my research focuses on topics at the intersection of labor, health, and development economics. I study how people and households make decisions over work and health in the face of market frictions. 

You can find my CV **[here](https://www.tanyarajan.com/assets/pdf/Rajan_CV_latest.pdf)**.
